# Create new features by extracting information from timestamps or aggregating statistical features
# For example, extracting hour of the day from the 'time' column
data['hour_of_day'] = data['time'].apply(lambda x: int(x // 3600 % 24))

# Creating statistical features
data['total_amount_std'] = data.groupby('hour_of_day')['transaction_amount'].transform('std')

# You can add more feature engineering steps based on your analysis
